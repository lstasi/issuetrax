# Issuetrax

A Kotlin mobile application for focused GitHub issue management and Pull Request reviews with innovative gesture-based navigation and simplified single-repository workflow.

## üöÄ Overview

Issuetrax is designed to revolutionize mobile code reviews by providing a clean, gesture-driven interface that makes reviewing Pull Requests on mobile devices intuitive and efficient. The app operates on a **simplified workflow model**: one repository, one issue/PR at a time, with primary focus on creating the best possible PR review experience using **inline diff views optimized for mobile screens**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Simplified Workflow**: One repository, one issue/PR focus at a time
- **Gesture-Based Navigation**: Revolutionary swipe controls for PR navigation
  - Swipe left/right: Navigate between files
  - Swipe up/down: Navigate between code hunks
  - Double tap: Expand/collapse code sections
  - Long press: Quick comment mode

- **Mobile-Optimized PR Reviews**: Inline diff views designed for mobile screens
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless OAuth authentication and full API integration
- **Source Code Browser**: Navigate repository files beyond the current PR
- **Clean Architecture**: MVVM with Clean Architecture principles

## üì± Screens

1. **Login & Repository Selection**: Combined GitHub OAuth authentication and single repository selection
2. **Current Work**: Display active issue/PR or provide simple creation interface
3. **PR Reviews**: Advanced gesture-based review interface with inline diff viewing (primary focus)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Built with modern Android development practices and **minimal essential dependencies**:

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose (Material 3)
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Clean Architecture
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **Networking**: Retrofit + OkHttp
- **Local Storage**: DataStore (preferences only)
- **Authentication**: GitHub OAuth 2.0 with Custom Tabs
- **Target**: Android 14+ (API 34) - No backward compatibility
- **Philosophy**: Simple UI, minimal dependencies, no unnecessary animations

## üé® Design Highlights

### Gesture Navigation System
The core innovation of Issuetrax is its gesture-based navigation system optimized for mobile PR reviews:

```
Horizontal Gestures:
‚Üê ‚Üí Navigate between PR files

Vertical Gestures:
‚Üë ‚Üì Navigate between code hunks

Special Gestures:
‚ö´‚ö´ Double tap to expand/collapse sections
üëÜ Long press for quick comments
```

### PR Review Interface
- **Inline diff view** optimized for mobile screens
- **Syntax highlighting** for various programming languages
- **Inline commenting** with suggestion support
- **Review submission** with approval workflow
- **File tree navigation** with quick search
- **Source code browser** for additional context

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Status

This repository currently contains the **definition and design phase** documentation. The implementation phase will follow the roadmap outlined in the project definition document.

### Development Phases

- [x] **Phase 0**: Requirements analysis and definition documents (simplified workflow)
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Foundation and GitHub OAuth implementation with repository selection
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Core screens (Auth, Current Work screen)
- [ ] **Phase 3**: PR Review core functionality with inline diff viewer
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Advanced gesture navigation system
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Polish, optimization, and source code browser
- [ ] **Phase 6**: APK generation and release preparation

## üéØ Target Output
