4. **Gesture Navigation**: Not implemented (planned for Phase 5)

These limitations are by design and documented in the project roadmap.

## Recommendations for Next Phase

### Phase 4: Review Submission
Before proceeding to Phase 4, ensure:
1. Run full manual test suite from `VALIDATION_DIFF_VIEWER.md`
2. Test on physical device (not just emulator)
3. Verify performance with real GitHub repositories
4. Conduct usability testing with target users

### Future Enhancements
Consider adding:
1. More file type tests (Swift, TypeScript, Python, etc.)
2. Performance tests with 1000+ line diffs
3. Memory leak detection tests
4. Accessibility tests (TalkBack, screen readers)
5. Screenshot comparison tests for UI regression
