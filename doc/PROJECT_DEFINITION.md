**Gesture Navigation System**:
- **Swipe Right**: Next file in PR
- **Swipe Left**: Previous file in PR
- **Swipe Up**: Next hunk/change in current file
- **Swipe Down**: Previous hunk/change in current file
- **Double tap**: Toggle between inline views (expanded/collapsed)
- **Pinch**: Zoom in/out for better readability
- **Long press**: Quick comment/suggestion mode

**Comment System**:
- Inline comments on specific lines

## GitHub Authentication

### OAuth 2.0 Implementation
- **Flow**: Authorization Code with PKCE
- **Scope**: `repo, read:user, read:org, write:discussion`
- **Token Storage**: Encrypted SharedPreferences
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic background refresh
- **Logout**: Clear stored tokens and redirect to login
